  - Some description about the *instacart* dataset<br/> *Instacart* is
    an anonymized dataset with over 3 million online grocery orders from
    more than 200,000 *Instacart* users. This dataset contains
    **1384617** rows and **15** columns. Observations are the level of
    items in orders by user. There are *order\_id, product\_id,
    add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number,
    order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order,
    product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department*
    variables. For some of key variables, the dataset provides
    information with **131209** unique orders and **39123** unique
    products with **21** departments which the products belong to.<br/>

### 1-2) How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
# Number of aisles
# Aisles with the most items ordered from

instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  count(aisle, name = "number_of_aisles") %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_of_aisles))
```

    # A tibble: 134 x 2
       aisle                         number_of_aisles
       <chr>                                    <int>
     1 fresh vegetables                        150609
     2 fresh fruits                            150473
     3 packaged vegetables fruits               78493
     4 yogurt                                   55240
     5 packaged cheese                          41699
     6 water seltzer sparkling water            36617
     7 milk                                     32644
     8 chips pretzels                           31269
     9 soy lactosefree                          26240
    10 bread                                    23635
    # ... with 124 more rows

  - Some comment on the result<br/> There are **134** aisles and *fresh
    vegetables* is the most item ordered from with **150609**
    orders.<br/>

### 1-3) Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
# Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle
# Limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered
# Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot

instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "number_of_aisles") %>% 
  filter(number_of_aisles > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, number_of_aisles)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = number_of_aisles)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "The number of items ordered in each aisle",
    x = "Aisle Name",
    y = "Number of Items Ordered",
    caption = "Data Source: Instacart") +
  ylim(0, 160000)
```

### 1-4) Make a table showing the three most popular items

``` r
# Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
# Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table

instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name, name = "number_of_orders") %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(number_of_orders))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

### 1-5) Make a table showing the mean hour of the day

``` r
# Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week
# Format this table for human readers

instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  mutate(order_dow = recode_factor
         (order_dow,
           "0" = "sunday",
           "1" = "monday",
           "2" = "tuesday",
           "3" = "wednesday",
           "4" = "thursday",
           "5" = "friday",
           "6" = "saturday")
         ) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>%

## Problem 2

### 2-1) Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data

``` r
acc_tidy_df =
  readr::read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "activity_counts"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    activity_day = ifelse(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")
    )

acc_tidy_df
```

    # A tibble: 50,400 x 6
        week day_id day    activity    activity_counts activity_day
       <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>                 <dbl> <chr>       
     1     1      1 Friday activity_1             88.4 weekday     
     2     1      1 Friday activity_2             82.2 weekday     
     3     1      1 Friday activity_3             64.4 weekday     
     4     1      1 Friday activity_4             70.0 weekday     
     5     1      1 Friday activity_5             75.0 weekday     
     6     1      1 Friday activity_6             66.3 weekday     
     7     1      1 Friday activity_7             53.8 weekday     
     8     1      1 Friday activity_8             47.8 weekday     
     9     1      1 Friday activity_9             55.5 weekday     
    10     1      1 Friday activity_10            43.0 weekday     
    # ... with 50,390 more rows

  - Some description of *accel\_data* dataset<br/> The initial
    *accel\_data* dataset comprised of *activity.\#* variables, which
    are the activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at
    midnight. This dataset was difficult for further analysis since all
    the *activity.\#* variables were shown as **1443** columns with
    **35** rows. Thus, I have transformed the data using `pivot_longer`
    in order to separate *activity* and *activity\_counts*. Next, I have
    added an additional column, *activity\_day*, to indicate whether the
    day was weekend or weekday. The tidy version of the dataset has the
    size of **6** columns and **50400** rows and comprises of week,
    day\_id, day, activity, activity\_counts, activity\_day variables. I
    didn’t find the need for encoding the variable classes, since all
    the variables already had reasonable variable classes (e.g., chr and
    dbl).<br/>

### 2-2) Aggregate minutes and create a table

``` r
acc_tidy_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day, activity_day) %>% 
  summarize(total_activiy_counts = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| week | day       | activity\_day | total\_activiy\_counts |

  - Some comment on the table<br/> From the table, it seems that, in
    general, there is an increasing trend of *total\_acitivity\_counts*
    on weekdays from Monday to Friday, excluding week 3 and week 4.
    Also, when I compared the mean of *total\_acitivity\_counts* between
    weekday (4.068228210^{5}) and weekend (3.2884510^{5}), it seems
    that, on average, there were more activity during the weekday
    compared to weekend.<br/>

<!-- end list -->

``` r
acc_tidy_df %>%

  summarize(total_activiy_counts = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  filter(activity_day == "weekend") %>% 
  pull(total_activiy_counts) %>% 
  mean()
```

  - Some description about the *ny\_noaa* dataset<br/> This dataset
    contains information for all New York state weather stations from
    January 1, 1981 through December 31, 2010. The dataset provides
    information with *id, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin*. The size
    of the dataset has **7** columns and **2595176** rows. Some key
    variables include precipitation *(prcp)* in tenth of mm, snowfall
    *(snow)* in mm, snow depth *(snwd)* in mm, and both maximum *(tmax)*
    and minimum *(tmin)* temperatures in tenths of degree Celcius.<br/>

When we observe the missing values, for precipitation, **145838**
values; for snowfall *(snow)*, **381221** values; for snow depth
*(snwd)*, **591786** values; for maximum temperatures *(tmax)* ,
**1134358** values; and for minimum temperatures *(tmin)* , **1134420**
values are missing, respectively. This leaves us with only **1222433**
complete observations.<br/>

### 3-1) For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values?

``` r
# Do some data cleaning
# Create separate variables
# Ensure observations are given in reasonable units

clean_ny_noaa =
  ny_noaa %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
    prcp = prcp * 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10,
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    year = as.numeric(year),
    month = as.numeric(month),
    day = as.numeric(day)
  )

clean_ny_noaa
```

  - Some description about the data cleaning process<br/> First, I have
    used `janitor::clean_names` to clean the column names. Then, I have
    separated *date* variable to year, month, and day. Next, before the
    unit conversion process, I have changed both max and min
    temperatures from *chr* to *dbl*. Finally, I have performed unit
    conversion on precipitation (1/10 mm) by multiplying 10 in order to
    match the unit with snowfall and snow depth which are all in mm. For
    both max and min temperatures, I have divided them by 10.<br/>

<!-- end list -->

``` r
clean_ny_noaa %>%
  group_by(snow) %>% 
  count(snow, name = "count") %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  head()
```

    # A tibble: 6 x 2
    # Groups:   snow [6]
       snow   count
      <int>   <int>
    1     0 2008508
    2    NA  381221
    3    25   31022
    4    13   23095
    5    51   18274
    6    76   10173

  - Comment on snowfall<br/> As we can see above, the most commonly
    observed value for snowfall is **0**mm, followed by **NA**,
    **25**mm, and **13**mm. We can assume that such result occurs as New
    York has seasonal weather. Furthermore, for light snowfalls, it
    might be possible that melting caused measuring the precise snowfall
    almost impossible.<br/>

### 3-2) Make a two-panel plot (1)

``` r

  select(id:month, tmax) %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month)) %>% 
  filter(month == "1" | month == "7") %>% 
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax)) %>%
  mutate(month = recode_factor(month, "1" = "January", "7" = "July")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, color = id)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(alpha = .5) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5)) +
    facet_grid(.~ month) +
